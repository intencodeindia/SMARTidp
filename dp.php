                                <p>Personal data is all information that relates to an identified or identifiable natural person. This includes, for example, information such as your name, age, address, telephone number, date of birth, email address,
                                    IP address or user behavior. If we are unable to draw any conclusions about such circumstances or if we require a disproportionate amount of time and effort to do so (e.g. because your data has been made anonymous),
                                    the data is not classified as personal data. The processing of personal data (which includes collecting, requesting, using, storing or transferring) always requires a legal basis or your consent. Processed personal
                                    data will be deleted as soon as the purpose of processing has been fulfilled and legal retention obligations no longer need to be observed.</p>
                                <p>If we process your personal data in order to provide you with a specific offer, we will inform you about the concrete processes, the scope and purpose of data processing, the legal basis for processing, and the
                                    retention period.</p>
                                <p>All mandatory fields are marked with the symbol *. Any sections of the website that require you to enter data will provide you with further information about precisely how your data is collected.</p>

                                <p>a. Purpose and scope of data processing<br>When accessing and using our website, we only collect personal data that your browser automatically transmits to our server. This information is temporarily stored in a
                                    log file. When you use our website, we collect the following data which we require for technical reasons in order to display our website to you and to ensure stability and security:</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>IP address of the computer being used</li>
                                    <li>The country in which you are located</li>
                                    <li>The date and duration of access</li>
                                    <li>The name and URL of the retrieved file</li>
                                    <li>The website from which you are accessing (referrer URL)</li>
                                    <li>The search term you used to get to our page, if a search machine was used</li>
                                    <li>The browser used and, potentially, the operating system of your computer</li>
                                    <li>The name of your access provider</li>
                                    <li>The website pages of SmartIDP that you visit</li>
                                    <li>The files that you have downloaded from our website (e.g. PDF documents)</li>
                                </ul>
                                <p>This data is analyzed by SmartIDP. It enables us to optimize our offers and to provide more personalized content for you — for example, to recognize if you are a new visitor to our website. If you have an existing data
                                    set, in many cases the new data will be assigned to this set.</p>
                                <p>b. Legal basis<br>Article 6 para. 1 lit. f GDPR serves as the legal basis for data processing as discussed here. To provide a website, the data mentioned here must be processed and thus serves the legitimate interests
                                    of our company.</p>
                                <p>c. Deletion and retention period<br>As soon as the aforementioned data required to show you the website is no longer needed, it will be deleted. The collection of data to provide a website and the storage of data
                                    in log files are absolutely necessary for the operation of an internet site. Consequently, the user has no possibility to object. Longer storage may occur in single cases if this is required by law.</p>

                                <p>To send newsletters, we use the double opt-in procedure. This means that we will only send you the newsletter once you have confirmed that you wish to receive it in a link sent to your email address, which you provide
                                    when registering. This way, we can make sure that you only you, the owner of the given email address, can register to read the newsletter. Your confirmation must take place quickly after receiving the confirmation
                                    email, otherwise your newsletter registration will be automatically deleted from our database.</p>

                                <p>After you have participated in an event, we ask you in the form of a survey for your feedback on the event. Based on the answers you give, we will send you related information and reading material either by email

                                <p><strong>2. Legal basis </strong></p>
                                <p>Due to the described purposes of usage (cf. § 6. a.), the legal basis for the processing of personal data using cookies is based on Article 6, Paragraph 1 of the GDPR.</p>

                                    we are able to further develop our online offerings. Based on these interests, the use of the tracking and analytics tools described below is justified in accordance with Article 6 para. 1 s. 1 lit. f GDPR.
                                    The following tracking and analytics tools demonstrate the purpose of processing and which data is processed.</p>
                                <p><strong>1.</strong> <strong>Google Analytics</strong></p>
                                <p>This website uses Google Analytics, a web analytics service provided by Google Ireland Limited, Google Building Gordon House, 4 Barrow St, Dublin, D04 E5W5, Irland (“Google”).&nbsp; Google Analytics uses cookies,
                                    which are text files placed on your computer to help the website analyze how users use the site.</p>
                                <p>The information generated by the cookie about, for example, your use of the website will be transmitted to and stored by Google on servers in the United States. When using Google Analytics, it is not excluded that
                                    cookies created by Google Analytics may collect other personal data in addition to the IP address. We would like to point out that Google may transfer this personal data to third parties if this is required
                                    by law or if third parties process this data on behalf of Google.</p>
                                <p>Based on cookies, Google will use this information on behalf of the operator of this website for the purpose of evaluating how you use the website, compiling reports on website activities and providing further services
                                    related to website and internet usage to the website operator. The IP address transferred by your browser within the scope of Google Analytics will not be merged with any other data held by Google, as Google
                                    itself states.</p>
                                <p>Generally speaking, you can prevent cookies from being saved by adjusting your browser settings. However, we would like to point out that if you do so, you may not be able to make use of all of this website's functions.</p>
                                <p>It is not excluded that cookies created by Google Analytics may collect other personal data in addition to the IP address. To prevent information about your use of this website from being collected by Google Analytics
                                    and transmitted to Google Analytics, you can download and install the following plug-in for your browser via this link: <a href="http://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout?hl=de">http://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout?hl=de</a>.
                                    This plug-in prevents information from your website visit from being transmitted to Google Analytics. The plug-in cannot prevent other analyses from taking place.</p>
                                <p>We would like to point out that you cannot use this plug-in when visiting our website via a browser of a mobile device (smartphone or tablet). When using a mobile device, you can prevent the collection of usage
                                    data by Google Analytics by clicking on the following link: <a href="javascript:gaOptout();alert('Google Analytics successfull deactivated!');">Disable Google Analytics.</a></p>
                                <p>You will be shown an opt-out cookie in your browser when you click on this. This prevents your personal data from being transmitted to Google Analytics. Please note that the opt-out cookie is only valid for this
                                    browser and only for this domain. If you delete cookies from this browser, the opt-out cookie will be deleted. To continue preventing Google Analytics from collecting data, you must click on the link again.
                                    You can also use the opt-out cookie as an alternative to the above plug-in when using the browser on your computer.</p>
                                <p>To ensure the best possible protection of your personal data, the code "anonymizeIp" has been added to Google Analytics on this website. This code ensures that the last 8 bits of the IP addresses are deleted and
                                    your IP address is thereby recorded anonymously (IP masking). Your IP address will thereby be truncated by Google before transmission within member states of the European Union or in other signatory states of
                                    the Agreement on the European Economic Area. Your IP address is thereby anonymized. Your full IP address will only be sent to a Google server in the USA and truncated there in exceptional cases.</p>
